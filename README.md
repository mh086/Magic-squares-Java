# Magic-squares-Java
Magic squares. An n x n matrix that is filled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n2 is 
a magic square if the sum of the elements in each row, in each column, and in the two diagonals is the 
same value.
Write a program that reads in 16 values from the keyboard, displays them in a 4 x 4 array, and tests 
whether they form a magic square.
